# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created to provide notes from the prework course. It gave me some experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about each of the topics, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Git. If you open up the DevTools console, you can see that JavaScript is running because it will list topics we learned from prework and choose a random topic to study.
